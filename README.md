# Json To Js Object

My custom plugins to convert JSON object to valid js object. Dont working in all cases.

Sometimes you may want to convert a json to a javascript object. For example you are getting json data from a api. You want to use that json object as javascript inside your application.
For example using dummy json object as valid js object in writing test cases.

Valid js object should use single quote around values.
Valid js object should use single quote in keys if key has special characters.

### `cmd+shift+p` then run `Json to js object` command
