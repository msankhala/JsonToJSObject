# Json To Js Object

My custom plugins to convert JSON object to valid js object. Do not work in all cases.

Sometimes you may want to convert a valid json response to a valid javascript object. For example you are getting json data from an api. You want to use that json response as javascript object inside your application.

### Use case 
Using dummy json object as valid js object in writing test cases.

Valid js object should use single quote around values as per eslint rule.
Valid js object should use single quote in keys name if key has special characters.

### Command
 `cmd+shift+p` then run `Json to js object` command
